# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a Rust project named `rust-mmap-test` using the 2024 edition. Currently, it's a minimal Rust project with a basic "Hello, world!" main function, likely intended as a starting point for memory-mapped file experiments.

## Common Commands

- **Build the project**: `cargo build`
- **Run the project**: `cargo run`
- **Build for release**: `cargo build --release`
- **Run tests**: `cargo test`
- **Check code without building**: `cargo check`
- **Format code**: `cargo fmt`
- **Run clippy lints**: `cargo clippy`

## Architecture

The project currently has a minimal structure:
- `src/main.rs`: Entry point with a basic main function
- No external dependencies defined in Cargo.toml
- Standard Cargo project layout

This appears to be a fresh Rust project template, likely intended for developing memory-mapped file functionality (based on the project name).
